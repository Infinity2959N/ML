# ML
This repo holds all the Jupyter notebooks and projects I have made for the GDG AI cohort weekly assignments. The notebooks aren't too advanced, and they are documented quite well, so any beginner can follow them easily.

Current projects in this repository:
1. AQI prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest (On real-world web scraped data)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Price prediction on 'Toyota Corolla' dataset on Kaggle.
