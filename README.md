# ML
This repo holds all the Jupyter notebooks and projects I have made for the GDG AI cohort. The notebooks aren't too advanced, and they are documented quite well, so any beginner can follow them easily.

Projects in this repository:
1. AQI prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest (On real-world web scraped data)
2. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis and Price prediction on 'Toyota Corolla' dataset on Kaggle.
3. Heart Disease prediction using Artificial Neural Network (and a lot of ML models as well)

**Machine Learning models you will find on these projects:**
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine
4. K-Nearest Neighbours
5. Naive-Bayes
6. Random Forest Ensemble
7. Gradient Boosting
8. Ada Boost
9. Artificial Neural Network (sequential model with dense layers)
