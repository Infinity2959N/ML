# ML
This repo holds all the Jupyter notebooks and projects I have made for the GDG AI cohort. The notebooks aren't too advanced, and they are documented quite well, so any beginner can follow them easily.

Projects in this repository:
1. AQI prediction using Linear Regression and Random Forest (On real-world web scraped data)
2. Simple streamlit app for Package prediction from CGPA using Linear Regression.
3. In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis and Price prediction on 'Toyota Corolla' dataset on Kaggle.
4. Heart Disease prediction using Artificial Neural Network (and a lot of ML models as well)

**Machine Learning models you will find on these projects:**
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine
4. K-Nearest Neighbours
5. Naive-Bayes
6. Random Forest Ensemble
7. Gradient Boosting
8. Ada Boost
9. Artificial Neural Network (sequential model with dense layers)

**File names:**
1. AQI using ml models: Air quality Index (pm 2.5) orediction using LinearRegression and Random Forest
2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Toyota Corolla Dataset: EDA (statistical, univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis) and price prediction using Random Forest
3. Heart Disease Prediction using ANN: Prediction of heart Disease on Kaggle's *Heart Disease* dataset using multiple ML models and a swquential ANN model.
4. Prediction: A simple, straightforward linear regression model to predict the salary Package using CGPA.
5. Model: A pickle file of the model generated from the Package prediction notebook.
6. App: Code for streamlit application for Package from CGPA prediction. Use this link to check out the app: https://package-pred.streamlit.app/
7. Requuirements: A list of required python libraries for the streamlit app to run.
